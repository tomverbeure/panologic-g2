###############################################################################

The sim/functional folder has files to perform functional simulation of the design.

1. Simulation using Modelsim simulator

A) sim.do File :
   
   1) The 'sim.do' file has commands to compile and simulate memory interface
      design and run the simulation for specified period of time. 
    
   2) It has the syntax to Map the required libraries.
      Also, $XILINX environment variable must be set in order to compile glbl.v file

   3) Displays the waveforms that are listed with "add wave" command.
     
B) Steps to run the Modelsim simulation:

   1) The user should invoke the Modelsim simulator GUI.
   2) Change the present working directory path to the sim/functional folder.
      In Transcript window, at Modelsim prompt, type the following command to 
      change directory path.
           cd <sim/functional directory path>

   2) Run the simulation using sim.do file.
      At Modelsim prompt, type the following command:
           do sim.do      

   3) To exit simulation, type the following command at Modelsim prompt:
           quit -f

   4) Verify the transcript file for the memory transactions.

C) For simulation with Elpida parts perform the following steps and then
   the above mentioned steps in 'B'

   1) Download the Elpida memory model from Elpida webpage.

   2) Update the memorymodel name in the vlog command given in sim.do file.


2. Simulation using ISIM simulator
  
A) Following files are provided :
   
   1) The '.prj' file contains the list of all the files associated with the design.
      It also contains the hdl, library and the source file name.       
    
   2) The '.tcl' file contains the Tcl commands for simulation and 
      resume on error. 

   3) The 'isim.bat' has commands which use '.prj' and '.tcl' files. 

     
B) Steps to run the ISIM simulation:

   The user should execute the file isim.bat, which does the following steps:
   1) Compiles, elaborates the design and generates the simulation executable using
      the fuse command in 'isim.bat' file.

   2) Invokes the ISIM GUI.

   3) User can add required signals from objects window to the waveform viewer and run 
      simulation for specified time using the command "run <time>" in ISIM GUI.

C) Simulations using ISIM simulator is not supported for Elpida parts.
